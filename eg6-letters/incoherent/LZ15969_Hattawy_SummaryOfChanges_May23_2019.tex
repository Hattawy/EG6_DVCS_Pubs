\section{Summary of Changes}
We agree with the referees' suggestions and implemented the changes to the paper:  

\begin{itemize}
   \item{ Per the recommendation of Referee A, we removed the ``only'' in the abstract.}
   \item{ Per the recommendation of Referee B, we removed ``to ensure the applicability of the DVCS handbag diagram'' and changed ``avoid'' to ``avoids'' at the end of page 3.}
   \item{ The figures have been adjusted to meet the maximum allowed length requirement.}   
\end{itemize}
