\item Second Proof: Please check and confirm the edit made in the sentence 
   ``With nuclear targets, deeply inelastic lepton scattering
...''\\
   \textcolor{blue}{Response: We are fine with adding ``European Muon 
      Collaboration (EMC) effect'' at the end of the sentence.} 

\item  Second Proof: Please carefully confirm that all first-proof corrections 
   were addressed and that changes were made accurately. \\

\item Second Proof: Please confirm the paper is now ready to be published in 
   its current form.\\  \textcolor{blue}{Response: Everything looks fine except 
      reference 41. Right click on the link somehow does not open the link 
      right away. We confirm that the link 
      \url{https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01218756/document} is right.  }
