\subsection*{\centering{Tuning the $^{4}He$ track parameters}}
- After the first and the second round comments, the $^{4}He$ track parameters 
have been tuned by looking at these parameters after the DVCS exclusivity 
cuts.\\
- In figure \ref{fig:He_pid_cuts}, I list the $^{4}He$ DVCS track parameters 
with the updated cuts.\\
- These cuts were applied to the following two analysis sets, except sdist cut 
on the old analysis set was [-3:3].\\

\subsection*{\centering{Exclusive distributions and reconstructed $A_{LU}$}}
After the suggestion from the review committee, I have changed the cut one the 
missing energy to be from [-0.45, 0.5] instead of a 3$\sigma$ cut on the 
distribution and refined all the other exclusive cuts. Figure 
\ref{fig:exc_cuts} presents the old and the new distributions for the exclusive 
variables.\\

- Note in the following plots, I will label the two analysis sets as "old", 3 
sigma cuts on all the variables, and "new", with the new missing energy cut and 
the corresponding updated 3 sigma cuts on the other variables.
